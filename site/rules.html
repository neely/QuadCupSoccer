<center><h1>Rules (that can be changed or ammended)</h1></center>
<br><br>
<dd>- this is more a guideline than a rule: People don't need to be goal tending but that doesn't mean you can't play defence on a person, just try to stay out of the goal and on the person. This will not be penalized but you will be yelled out and potentially severly beaten if you do it.<img src="update.gif">
</dd><dd>- Hand balls and other blatant fouls are penanlized with a free direct kick by the other team.<img src="update.gif">
</dd><dd>- Play will start by a ball being kicked really high in the middle of the field.<img src="update.gif">
</dd><dd>- Players cannot goal tend which means no loitering or playing after the ball versus the goal instead of the ball versus an opponent. <img src="update.gif"><br>
</dd><dd>- The ball cannot come back through the plane of the goal as a pass to a player on the goal line for a tap in goal<img src="update.gif"><br>
</dd><dd>- We will be playing with cones to mark the goal and a goal will not count if it moves a cone. <img src="update.gif"><br>
</dd><dd>-We play on the quad (possibly play on real fields if the league decides)
</dd><dd>-There is no out of bounds (except extreme cases) and play NEVER stops
</dd><dd>-There are goals but no goalies with a goal being scored by ball going on ground through goals a certain direction (possibly below knee level will be allowed)
</dd><dd>-Play will last for an hour.
</dd><dd>-We have no ref but this is not meant to get too violent. This originates with pickup ball and we want to keep from hating each other. If for some reason you hurt someone, you leave the field with them until they return. Also, we have each other to keep it from going sour. Don't worry, it'll still be fun.
</dd><dd>-We will have as much of season as possible until the tournament: Quad Cup Spring 2001 where the victors will take all.
</dd><dd>-Due to the take all part of the above statement, each team member must give $2 to me. This will make a $60 pot for either the yellow t-shirts or alcohol. It might even turn into just a big party so don't think you are wasting your money, all the teams are good anyway so deal with it. Get the money to Ben Neely by the time the tournament rolls around or you can't play in it. If you really can't afford it talk to Ben about it.
</dd><dd>-All teams except one have 5 members. We can play all five at once with no subs or play fewer. The teams playing at the time will decide and the tournament will probably be 4 on with one sub but this too can be changed.
</dd><dd>-Walk-ons during friendly games is allowed on the condition that the other team accepts the walk-on.
</dd><dd><b>-If you don't like any of these rules, <a indepth="true" href="message.html">email Ben</a> or talk to someone about it and eventually tell Ben. This is a very democratic thing but its point is to get people at games and to have something to play for ($$/beer).</b>
