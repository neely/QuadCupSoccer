<center><h1>Elton John Fan CLub (FC)</h1></center><br><br>
<dd> This team is probably the most well balanced but this doesn't ensure domination. They are out to dominate and win the Cup. They play for Elton John because he has such smooth tunes. Lee even brags about an evening spent with the man himself. The team is Lee, Jamie, Lindsay "Stoner", Ben "No ass", Sean "Weed", and Andy (he's just damn cool). If this team can get all their players to the games, they have a shot at doing a lot of damage to the other teams records. If anything, they hope this season will allow them to make enough money to go to NYC and see Elton John's new musical, Aeida. Maybe, right now they will play soccer and try to keep the drinking down.<br><br>
