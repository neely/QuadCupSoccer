<center><h1>Mrs. Wolf is Hot!</h1></center><br><br>
<dd> This is a group of crazy guys that originate from the same on-campus boys club. Don't hold it against them though because they are the closest team which could mean problems early on. They are Aramus, Keagan, Andy M., Dan, James, and Kris. These guys play with a lot of energy because they all have a thing for this dude's mom. Hopefully, with a Quad Cup Title they will finally be able to impress her and possibly get in her pants.
