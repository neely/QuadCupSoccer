<dd>This team is a very interesting team. They have two guys who think they can play soccer but that doesn't mean much in the quad. They will be out to contend for the prize and with one of the more intimidating names, it could happen. They are Matt W., Tyler W., Todd, Joe M., and Mike Y. Yes, they have a lot of initials but they are big and tough.<br><br>
