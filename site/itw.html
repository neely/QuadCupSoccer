<dd>These gusy might aprty a little bit but they have some key players that are bound to kick some ass. They are Clint "The Snake", Craig "butters", Super Sexy Steve, Maciej, Josh, and Nate W. They drink special water that gives them some sort of advantage, we are not sure what it is though. They want the title and will be sure to give some crazy plays here and there and be a very all around strong team.<br><br>
