# QuadCupSoccer


This is the download of a GeoCities website from Spring 2001 that I had created for this silly thing we did at Western Maryland College (now McDaniel College) when I was a sophmore (so keep that in mind if you see anything that's not PG). Think of it as an anything goes pickup soccer league. If you so wish to explore this site, download all the files into a single directory, and find index.html to start you on your throwback journey.
