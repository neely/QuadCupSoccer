This is the download of a geocities website from 2001 that I had created for this silly thing we did at Western Maryland College (now McDaniel) college when I was a sophmore (so keep that in mind if you see anything that's not PG). If you so wish to explore this site, download all the files into a single directory, and find index.html to start you on your throwback journey.
